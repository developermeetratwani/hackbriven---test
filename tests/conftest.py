def _no_real_mongo_by_default(monkeypatch):
    """Project-wide safety net: .env now carries a real MONGODB_URI for the
    live app, which backend/core/job_manager.py and backend/core/credits.py
    both read as a module-level `from backend.config import settings`
    singleton. Without this, any test that doesn't explicitly mock settings
    (e.g. tests/test_api.py, which drives the real job_manager singleton
    through TestClient) would silently hit the live database on every job
    create/update - confirmed live: it turned an ~80s offline suite into an
    8+ minute one hitting a real remote cluster repeatedly, and would have
    been writing test job documents into the real app's data.

    monkeypatch (not @patch) is used so this mutates the real settings
    singleton's attribute directly and auto-reverts after each test; any
    test that still wants real-Mongo behavior (e.g. the dedicated
    _mongo_mode fixtures in test_job_manager.py/test_credits.py) replaces
    `settings` wholesale with its own mock, which fully shadows this for
    that test's duration.
